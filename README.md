# Rayyan-Goraya-HDSB-2023-Hackathon
To see the work we did you can open sketch.js and after that you can open Logic.js(this has the function to check if the answer is correct for the fun quiz at the end). The rest are libraries. 
The Team Members:  Aditya Chakravorty, And Rayyan Goraya. Theme: Environment Sustainability. Type: Software. Our project is created using JavaScript and the games main focus is to spread awareness to others about the problems in the world in a fun way. This game tells others to live in a sustainable way so they can help slow down the process of global warming.  It also tells others some interesting facts related to the problems in the world. In the first level of the game you are at a lake and you need to collect all the plastic water bottles. Marine life is affected by plastic. In the next level of the game you are going on a road trip and you need to drive yourself and your friend to the destination. Then In the third level of the game you see a polar bear stranded on an ice piece. You need to help him catch some fish by moving the ice pieces and then take him home. Lastly this game also has a fun and interactive quiz at the end too. In the quiz there are 5 questions and the answers are only one word. We put a lot of effort into this project and also had a lot of fun creating this game.
